Through the use of a couple different APIs, we are able to pull data (or append data to a file) based on the user input within
the CLI. We use the spotify API, twitter API, OMDB (movie database) API. Using node from the command line, you are able to pull tweets from my personal twitter (hopefully nothing completely vulgar). I wisely have limited the count you can pull to 20, though that's more than enough to do plenty of damage to my reputation. You're also able to scour movie database based off of any legitimate movie you type in. This includes plot, actors, year, genre, etc. Also, same with any song! Type in 'node liri.js spotify-this-song [your song name]' and see the results. Lastly, the do-what-it-says command, reads the file random.txt and gives you the result!
